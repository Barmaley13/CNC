DIY CNC and CNC Designs

I wanted to make my own furniture and I finished my first design but
the DIY club where I was going to build my furniture closed down. So no more community CNC.
That made me thinking, well why not to build my own CNC machine?

And the journey begins...

I wanted to have a place for my designs online. Why not make it public, right?
Create greater good for everyone else.

I will use this repo to store and share both CNC machine bits and pieces as well as CNC designs.
Most of the mechanical designs will be done in SolidWorks.

Like minded people are more that welcome to join!
